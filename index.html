      <p>Select a system above to see all the safe spots in that system. A safe
      spot is calculated by looking at the midpoint between 2 celestials
      (planets and sun only atm) and calculating the midpoint between those
      midpoints and another celestial. Those results are then filtered down to
      only show safe spots that are greater than the 14.3 AU range of DScan from
      a celestial.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blue dots are celestials (Sun and Planets)</li>
        <li>Red dots are safe points</li>
      </ul>
